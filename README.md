# 👋 Hi, I’m Radojica Popović  
**Senior Software Engineer** focused on modern full-stack (React / Next.js / TypeScript) systems, scalable backend services, and clean product-minded execution.  
Based in Serbia. Open to impactful remote or hybrid roles.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Build and refactor complex developer tools and web applications with minimal logic disruption.  
- Design and ship full-stack features: Next.js frontends, Node.js/TypeScript backends, PostgreSQL data layers, and scalable API infrastructure.  
- Prototype, validate, and iterate on MVPs for early-stage products-balancing speed with maintainability.  
- Mentor/architect tooling around editor experiences, data pipelines, and observability in high-feedback environments.

## 🧪 How I Work
- **Lift-and-shift refactors** when needed: minimal behavioral change, maximum structural clarity.  
- **Data-first** feature design: collect, normalize, flag, act-iterating with feedback loops.  
- **Product-aware engineering:** I don’t just write code; I shape what gets built and why.


> “I prefer building things from ground up, maintaining existing logic while improving structure, and shipping with clear intent.”
