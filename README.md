# 👋 Hi, I’m Radojica Popović  
**Senior Software Engineer** focused on modern full-stack (React / Next.js / TypeScript) systems, scalable backend services, and clean product-minded execution.  
Based in Serbia. Open to impactful remote or hybrid roles.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Build and refactor complex developer tools and web applications with minimal logic disruption.  
- Design and ship full-stack features: Next.js frontends, Node.js/TypeScript backends, PostgreSQL data layers, and scalable API infrastructure.  
- Prototype, validate, and iterate on MVPs for early-stage products—balancing speed with maintainability.  
- Mentor/architect tooling around editor experiences, data pipelines, and observability in high-feedback environments.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**  
React · Next.js · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · CSS-in-JS  

**Backend / Infra:**  
Node.js · PostgreSQL · REST APIs · NestJS (familiarity) · Docker · Redis  

**Tools:**  
pnpm · Vercel · Git · Linux · Web APIs  

## 🔍 Selected Highlights

### Senior Software Engineer @ Neobim  
- Refactored core in-editor tools (e.g., Rotate Tool) into a controller-based architecture while preserving original behavior and improving maintainability.  
- Solved complex UI/Three.js integration issues involving singletons and multi-instance conflicts.  
- Delivered robust selection & transformation workflows in a collaborative CAD/editor environment.

### Full Stack & Systems Work  
- Designed and implemented country-aware phone input systems with real-time validation for assessments (e.g., Libphonenumber integration, auto-detection logic).  
- Built and deployed modular social media / content tracking prototypes with normalized pipelines, keyword flagging, and RBAC scaffolding.

## 🧪 How I Work
- **Lift-and-shift refactors** when needed: minimal behavioral change, maximum structural clarity.  
- **Data-first** feature design: collect, normalize, flag, act—iterating with feedback loops.  
- **Product-aware engineering:** I don’t just write code; I shape what gets built and why.

## 📂 Projects (examples)
- **Elden Ring Trivia Engine** – Custom randomized bingo/trivia system for community tournaments.  
- **PhoneInput Assessment Tool** – Universal phone number validator with locale detection used across multiple forms.  
- **Social Media Monitoring Prototype** – Public content collector + normalization + keyword intelligence with role-based access.  
- **Portfolio/Dev-Folio** – Next.js/Tailwind portfolio with About, Experience, Projects, and Resume pages.
