# 👋 Hi, I’m Radojica Popović  
Hi, I’m Radojica Popović — a full-stack TypeScript engineer who ships fast, clean, and well-typed products. I care about readable code, small PRs, and UIs that feel instant. Coffee is my unofficial build step ☕. When things get complex, I simplify, then document.

Usually with: TypeScript, Next.js, Node/Bun, React.


> “I prefer building things from ground up, maintaining existing logic while improving structure, and shipping with clear intent.”
