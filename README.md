# 👋 Hi, I’m Radojica Popović  
Senior Full-Stack TypeScript dev. I turn fuzzy ideas into shippable features without over-engineering. I start with types and contracts, sketch the UI quickly, wire the API, then iterate with real feedback. I’m serious about DX and performance, allergic to unnecessary complexity, and powered by coffee (commits get shorter as the espresso gets stronger).
 
Tech I enjoy: TypeScript · Next.js · Node.     
     
 
> “I prefer building things from ground up, maintaining existing logic while improving structure, and shipping with clear intent.”
